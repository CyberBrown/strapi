Based on the Dockerfile and package.json in your project, here are the equivalent commands to yarn build and yarn run dev when using Docker:

For yarn build:
The yarn build command is part of the Docker image build process. You don't run it separately. Instead, you build the entire Docker image, which includes that step.

Command:

bash

docker build -t my-strapi-app .
This command tells Docker to build an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag it with the name my-strapi-app.

For yarn run dev:
The Dockerfile specifies that the container should start with CMD ["yarn", "start"]. The start script in your package.json is "start": "strapi start", which is the command for running Strapi in production. The dev script is "develop": "strapi develop". While they are slightly different (develop is for development with auto-reloading), the Docker equivalent to run your application is:

Command:

bash

//dont use docker run -p 1337:1337 my-strapi-app
docker-compose up

This command starts a container from the my-strapi-app image and maps port 1337 from the container to port 1337 on your local machine, allowing you to access the Strapi application.

In summary:

Instead of yarn build, you use docker build -t my-strapi-app .
Instead of yarn run dev, you use docker run -p 1337:1337 my-strapi-app
I have analyzed the files and provided the Docker-equivalent commands as requested. The task is now complete.

Of course. Based on the files in your project, here are the Docker commands that replace yarn build and yarn run dev.

For yarn build:
To build your application within a Docker container, you use the docker build command. This command reads the Dockerfile, installs dependencies, and runs the yarn build script defined in your package.json.

bash

docker build -t strapi-app .
docker build: The command to build a Docker image.
-t strapi-app: This tags the image with the name strapi-app so you can easily refer to it later.
.: This tells Docker to use the Dockerfile in the current directory.
For yarn run dev:
To run your application in development mode, you'll use the docker run command. You also need to tell Docker to run the develop script instead of the default start script.

bash

docker run -p 1337:1337 strapi-app yarn develop
docker run: The command to start a new container from an image.
-p 1337:1337: This maps port 1337 inside the container to port 1337 on your computer, so you can access the application in your browser.
strapi-app: The name of the image you built earlier.
yarn develop: This overrides the default command in the Dockerfile and runs strapi develop, starting the development server.
